developing the dashboard with Upload File functionality using the MERN Stack:

1. Frontend (ReactJS):

Components:

UploadFile: This component will handle file selection and upload logic.
DataTable: This component will display the data fetched from the API in a table format.
Functionality:

UploadFile component should allow users to select a file.
Upon selecting a file, trigger a function to upload the file data to the backend API.
DataTable component should make a GET request to the backend API to retrieve data.
The API response should populate the table with relevant columns and rows.
2. Backend (ExpressJS and Mongoose):

API Endpoints:

/upload: This endpoint will handle file upload requests.
/data: This endpoint will retrieve data from MongoDB and respond with JSON data.
Functionality:

/upload endpoint should:
Parse the uploaded file data (depending on file format - CSV, JSON, etc.)
Connect to the MongoDB database using Mongoose.
Save the parsed data to a MongoDB collection.
Return a success or error response to the frontend.
/data endpoint should:
Connect to the MongoDB database using Mongoose.
Retrieve data from the relevant collection.
Send the retrieved data as JSON response to the frontend.
3. Database (MongoDB):

Design a schema for the data you want to store.
The schema should define the structure of each data point based on the uploaded file format.
Use Mongoose to connect to the MongoDB cluster and interact with the data.
Here's an example structure (replace placeholders with your specific needs):

Frontend (ReactJS):

UploadFile component can utilize libraries like react-dropzone for file selection and upload functionality.
DataTable component can use libraries like material-ui or react-bootstrap for table formatting and styling.
Backend (ExpressJS and Mongoose):

Use multer middleware for handling file uploads.
Use Mongoose ODM to define the data schema and interact with MongoDB.
Deployment:

You can deploy the frontend (React app) to a platform like Netlify or Vercel.
Deploy the backend API (NodeJS server) to a platform like Heroku or AWS.
Configure the API endpoint URLs in the React app to point to the deployed backend server.
